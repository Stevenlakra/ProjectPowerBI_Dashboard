5.	Features / Highlights
Business Problem
Electro Hub operates a physical retail store with diverse product lines such as Electronics, Footwear, Clothing, Home Appliances, and more. However, business managers and analysts often lack a unified, visual way to evaluate product performance, profitability, and customer purchasing behavior.
Key questions such as:
1) Top/Bottom 5 product by Sales/Profit/Quantity Sold.
2) How do sales trends vary over time (daily, monthly, quarterly, annually) ?
3) Show relationship between sales & profit.
4) Compare sales/profit/quantity sold between any two periods selected by the user.
5) Average discount offered in each discount category.
6) Total number of orders.
7) Show Sales/Profit/Discount/Net Sales/All remaining fields for each order that could be filtered using visual filters. (Product/Date/Customer ID/Promotion Categories)
8) Show sales by different cities.

Goal of the Dashboard
1) To deliver an interactive Power BI tool that:
2) Provides clear insights into top and bottom-performing products.
3) Tracks sales trends across different time periods.
4) Identifies relationships between sales, profit, discounts, and geography.
5) Supports strategic decisions around pricing, promotions, inventory, and sales planning.

Business Impact & Insights

•	Forecast Trends: Track sales over time to improve inventory, staffing, and seasonal planning.
•	Maximize Profitability: Understand sales–profit relationships and refine discount strategies.
•	Measure Campaign Impact: Compare periods to evaluate promotions and business growth.
